## Data
We collected and preprocessed trade data from reliable sources, ensuring its accuracy and relevance. You can find detailed information about the data sources and preprocessing steps in our [Data Documentation](link-to-data-docs.md).

## Analysis and Insights
Our project includes a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the trade data. We have extracted meaningful insights, including trade balances, trends over time, and regional trade patterns. You can explore these insights in our [Analysis Notebook](link-to-analysis-notebook.ipynb).

## Machine Learning Model (Optional)
If applicable, we have implemented a machine learning model to predict trade trends based on historical data. Details of the model, its training process, and performance metrics can be found in our [Machine Learning Documentation](link-to-ml-docs.md).

## Gradio Interface
Our user-friendly Gradio interface allows you to interact with the trade data analysis in real-time. You can explore trade trends, visualize data, and make custom queries using various input components. Check out our [Live Demo](link-to-live-demo) to see it in action.

## Usage
To run TradeAnalytica locally or deploy it to your own server, follow the instructions in our [Usage Guide](link-to-usage-guide.md).

## Deployment
We have provided deployment instructions for popular platforms such as AWS, Heroku, and Docker. Choose the one that best suits your needs in our [Deployment Guide](link-to-deployment-guide.md).

## Testing
We have conducted thorough testing of the application to ensure its functionality and performance. You can find details about our testing approach and how to run tests in our [Testing Documentation](link-to-testing-docs.md).

## Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available to guide you through using and extending TradeAnalytica. Refer to our [Documentation](link-to-full-docs.md) for detailed information.
